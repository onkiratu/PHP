My idea for a project would be a database for entering student information, including performance and grading for them. 
There are many ideas for a school database.

-They do not have to be unique since we should be settling for one in order to develope PHP interfaces for entering their
  information.
-Your second task is to learn how to create a database in wamp/xammp. Respond showing the process you used to create it.
-The third task is to develope the database for the project.
